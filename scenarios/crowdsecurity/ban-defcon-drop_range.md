Scenario to ban a range if more than 5 IPs from said range are banned less than 1 minute apart.

For this to work, two non-default things must be set:

1. You must append a profile that will process decisions on ranges:

> /etc/crowdsec/profiles.yaml

```yaml
#...
---
name: default_range_remediation
filters:
 - Alert.Remediation == true && Alert.GetScope() == "Range"
decisions:
 - type: ban
   duration: 4h
on_success: break
```

2. The related scenario(s) must be configured to have [reprocess](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/next/scenarios/format/#reprocess) set to `true`: This is needed for the events (generated by the scenarios) to be processed again by CrowdSec so they can trigger our `crowdsecurity/ban-defcon-drop_range` scenario. Most scenarios do not have this option enabled by default.
