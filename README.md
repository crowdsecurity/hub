> CrowdSec Hub for parsers, enrichers and scenarios.

# Foreword

This repository stores most of the official parsers/scenarios/collections for crowdsec.

The repository is not intended for use as-is, but rather as source of truth for the [CrowdSec Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/) and `cscli`.

Feel free to use the parsers/scenarios here as a source of inspiration.


The results of the continuous integration tests can be seen at [https://crowdsecurity.github.io/hub/](CI tests results)
