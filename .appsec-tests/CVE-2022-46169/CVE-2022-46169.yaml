  description: |
    Cacti through 1.2.22 is susceptible to remote command injection. There is insufficient authorization within the remote agent when handling HTTP requests with a custom Forwarded-For HTTP header. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected instance and execute arbitrary OS commands on the server, thereby making it possible to obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.
