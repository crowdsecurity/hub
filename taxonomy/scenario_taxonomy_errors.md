Information about mitre attack can be found [here](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/).
As an example, some common mitre attack techniques:
 - T1110 for bruteforce attacks
 - T1595 and T1190 for exploitation of public vulnerabilities
 - T1595 for generic scanning of exposed applications

[Here](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/scenarios/format#labels) is the CrowdSec documentation on how to fill those labels
