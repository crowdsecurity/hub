## NPMplus collection

A collection to defend nginx against common attacks:
 - [NPMplus](https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager) parser
 - base http scenarios (crawl, 404 scan, bf)

## Acquisition template

Example acquisition for this collection:

```yaml
filenames:
  - /opt/npm/nginx/access.log
labels:
  type: npmplus

source: docker
container_name:
 - npmplus
labels:
  type: npmplus
---
source: docker
container_name:

notes:
 -  If you are using `syslog`, set type to `syslog` instead
 -  Depending on your configuration, paths to log files might change
 -  Only relevant if you are manually installing collection
