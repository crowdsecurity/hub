A collection of defensive (implementation independent) scenarios for http services :
 - aggressive crawl detection
 - scanning/probing detection
 - bad user-agent detection
 - path traversal detection
 - sensitive data access attempts detection
 - SQL injection detection
 - administration interface probing detection

:warning: This collection is _not_ a WAF and this scenario does _not_ aims at replacing a WAF.
