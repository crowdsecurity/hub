# AppSec Virtual Patching

This collection contains virtual patching for commonly exploited vulnerabilities, and is inspired by the [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog). The goal is to provide virtual patching capabilities for the most often exploited vulnerabilities, avoiding false positives while catching people scouting your applications for juicy vulnerabilities.
