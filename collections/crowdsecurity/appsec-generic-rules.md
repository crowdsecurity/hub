# AppSec Generic Rules

This collection contains generic scenarios for appsec. These generic rules try to detect attack vectors that might be used to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities. For instance, a scenario could look for calls such as `cat /etc/passwd`. The goal of this collection is to provide some level of protection in cases where a scenario for the specific vulnerability is absent.
