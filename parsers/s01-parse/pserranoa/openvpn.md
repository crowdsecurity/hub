# OpenVpn

A parser for [openvpn Community](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/) logs.

- Tested with OpenVPN 2.6.3.
- Parser was created for level 3. (verb 3)

From [openvpn reference manual](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/reference-manual-for-openvpn-2-6/)

```code
--verb n

Set output verbosity to n (default 1). Each level shows all info from the previous levels. Level 3 is recommended if you want a good summary of what's happening without being swamped by output.
```
