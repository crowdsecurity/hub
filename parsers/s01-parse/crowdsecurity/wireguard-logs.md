In order for CrowdSec to detect attacks on Wireguard it needs logs and since Wireguard by default logs close to nothing we need to enable Wireguard's dyndbg logging which sends log messages to the Linux kernel message buffer, `kmsg`. 
These will be picked up by your Linux distro's syslog service (at least on Debian, probably also on most others) and logged in `/var/kern.log`. On other distros they will be logged to `/var/log/messages`.

To enable Wireguard's dyndbg logging:
```console
$ sudo modprobe wireguard
$ echo module wireguard +p | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
```
